Hi!! I'm Bhairavi Vernu (you can also call me V), I'm a fourth-year Computer Science and Engineering major, and welcome to my IN-PROGRESS personal website :)

Coded in my spare time in HTML and CSS, you can find out more about my professional interests and hobbies, as well as my resume and portfolio.
